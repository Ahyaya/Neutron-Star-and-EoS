# M-R-I-Love
codes for computing non-rotating neutron stars, including:
1. gravitational mass M
2. radius R
3. dimensionless moment of inertia  I
4. dimensionless tidal deformability  Lambda
5. baryon mass  Ma
6. pure mass  Mp

The current version Textor uses both testR-3 and testR-2 method to iterate.
Containing parameterized asymmetric nucleonic matter equation of state (ANM EOS) generator, the computation outputs are saved in the path .\\Results\\num.txt, while the three parameters are saved in .\\EoSpara.txt in the root path.
